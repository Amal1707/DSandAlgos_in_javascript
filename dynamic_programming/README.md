<b>Dynamic Programming in Javascript<b>

what is Dynamic Programming?
"A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub problems, solving wach of those sub problems just once, and storing their solutions.

It works on problems with Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Subproblems.

Overlapping Subproblems:
A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times.
Ex: Fibonacci sequence

Optimal Substructure:
A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
Ex: Fibonacci sequence, Shortest Path

Memoization:
Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
